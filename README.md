# AR Video Player Project

## Overview
This project showcases an Augmented Reality (AR) experience using Unity and Vuforia. The application allows users to trigger video playback by interacting with a virtual button in the AR space. The video appears on a cube object, and the button also changes color based on the video's playback state (playing or paused).

## Features
- AR Interaction: Utilize Vuforia's virtual button technology to trigger actions in AR space.
- Video Playback: A video is played on a 3D cube when the virtual button is pressed.
- Dynamic Button Colors: The button changes its color depending on whether the video is playing (red) or paused (green).
